# FIELD JOURNAL: THE OPERATIONAL LOG
## A Companion to The Red Book

---

## LOGBOOK PHILOSOPHY

> "A captain who does not keep a log is just a tourist."

This journal is your central repository for observations, patterns, and plans. It is not a diary; it is a neurological tool for **Cognitive Offloading**. By moving your thoughts from the emotional centers of the brain to the physical page, you engage the analytical power of the prefrontal cortex.

**THE PROTOCOL:**
* **Physcial:** Use a pen. Do not type.
* **Morning Watch:** Set the course before the day begins.
* **Evening Debrief:** Review the data and adjust the trajectory.
