# THE RED BOOK: Cover Design Brief (Affinity V1)

## 1. Technical Specifications (5" x 7" Trim)

If you are using KDP (Amazon) or IngramSpark, your cover is **one single file** containing:

**Calculation (Assuming ~170 pages / Cream Paper):**

- **Front Cover:** 5" x 7"
- **Back Cover:** 5" x 7"
- **Spine Width:** Approx. 0.34" (Check KDP/IngramSpark Calculator once final page count is known)
- **Bleed:** 0.125" all around
- **Total Canvas Width:** 5 + 5 + 0.34 + 0.25 = **10.59"**

**Header:** YOU ARE NOT BROKEN. YOU ARE MUTINOUS.

**Body:**
Inside every person are two forces: the Operator—the rational commander—and the Passenger—the reactive, pleasure-seeking part that hijacks the controls.

*The Red Book* is a field manual for the part of you that wants to win. Built on neuroscience and structured like military protocols, it provides the exact systems needed to break anxiety loops, manage relapse, and take the bridge.

**Includes:**

- The Morning Watch & Evening Debrief rituals
- The H.A.L.T. sanity check
- Emergency protocols for panic and crisis
- Environment design for the modern Operator
