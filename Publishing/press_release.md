## New Book "THE RED BOOK" Offers Neuroscience-Backed Field Manual for Mental Self-Command

*A practical guide treating self-improvement like military operations — with protocols, not platitudes*

---

**[CITY, STATE] — [DATE]** — Author [AUTHOR NAME] announces the release of **THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command**, a groundbreaking self-help book that combines neuroscience with a naval command metaphor to help readers take control of their minds, habits, and lives.

Unlike traditional self-help books that rely on inspiration and motivation, THE RED BOOK is structured as a literal field manual — complete with protocols, templates, and emergency procedures for everything from daily productivity to panic attacks.

### The Core Concept

The book introduces readers to two forces battling for control of every decision:

- **The Operator**: The rational, long-term-thinking prefrontal cortex — the part of you that sets goals and makes plans
- **The Passenger**: The reactive, pleasure-seeking limbic system — the part that hijacks the controls and derails your intentions

"Every self-sabotaging behavior makes sense when you understand the Passenger," says [AUTHOR NAME]. "This book is about giving the Operator the tools to take back the bridge."

### What's Inside

THE RED BOOK covers:

- **Daily Protocols**: Morning Watch, Evening Debrief, and Standing Orders for consistent execution
- **The Hardware Reset**: Neuroscience-backed systems for sleep, nutrition, and movement
- **The Red Book Protocol**: Cognitive offloading through structured journaling
- **Crisis Management**: Specific protocols for panic attacks, relapse, and late-night anxiety spirals
- **Environment Design**: How to structure your physical and digital spaces to support your goals
- **Relationship Systems**: Building a "Bridge Crew" of supportive people and navigating toxic dynamics

Each chapter includes case studies, workable templates, and a summary of "Operator's Orders" — specific, actionable steps readers can implement immediately.

### Who It's For

THE RED BOOK is designed for:

- Adults navigating addiction recovery, anxiety, or major life transitions
- High-performers seeking structured systems for consistency
- Anyone who knows what they *should* do but struggles to do it
- Readers who prefer practical tools over abstract inspiration

### Availability

THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command is available now in paperback and ebook formats:
