## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (The Mutiny)

**Headline:**
**YOU ARE NOT BROKEN. YOU ARE MUTINOUS.**

**Body Copy:**
Inside your head, there are two forces fighting for control:

1. **The Operator (Prefrontal Cortex):** The rational planner. The part of you that wants to build, grow, and succeed.
2. **The Passenger (Limbic System):** The reactive survivor. The part of you that wants comfort, dopamine, and safety *right now*.

Most self-help fails because it tries to *motivate* the Passenger.
**The Red Book** teaches you to **command** it.
