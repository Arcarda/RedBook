# Red Book 3.0.2: Styling & Table of Contents Guide

This guide covers the "final polish" of your interior layout using the **Affinity 3.0.2 Unified App**.

---

## 1. Table of Contents (ToC) Generation

The ToC is automated based on your **Paragraph Styles**.

### Setup

1. Go to the blank page you reserved for the ToC (usually page `v` or `vii` in the Front Matter).
2. Open the **Table of Contents Panel** (View → Studio → Table of Contents).
3. In the panel settings, check the boxes for:
   - `H1-Chapter`
   - `H2-Section` (Optional, if you want sub-chapters listed)
4. Click **Insert TOC** at the top of the panel.
5. Draw a text frame on the page to place the TOC.

### Formatting the TOC

- Affinity will create new styles like `TOC 1: H1-Chapter`.
- Edit these styles to add **Tab Stops** with a **Leader** (the `....` dots).
- Tip: Set the Tab Stop to `4.5 in` with a Right alignment to keep the page numbers perfectly flush.

## 2. Refining "Operator's Orders" (Pinned Objects)

In 3.0.2, the **Pinning** feature ensures your summary boxes don't get separated from their chapters.

### Creating the Unified Box

1. Create your gray box with the header "OPERATOR'S ORDERS".
2. Group all elements (**Ctrl+G**).
3. With the group selected, open the **Pinning Panel**.
4. Click **Floating**.
5. Move the "Anchor" icon to the end of the chapter text.
6. Now, if you add or remove text above, the entire box will slide up or down with the flow.

## 3. Styling "Case Briefs"

Treat these as "callout" sections to break up long text blocks.

- **Paragraph Style:** Create a `Body-CaseBrief` style.
- **Indent:** Set `Left Indent` to **0.5 in** and `Right Indent` to **0.5 in**.
- **Font:** Use **Montserrat** or **Inter** (Sans Serif) for a "dossier" look.
- **Icon:** Use the **Image Trace** version of the "Sextant" icon at the top of the block.

## 4. The 3.0.2 "Pre-Flight" Check

Before we calculate the cover spine:

1. Go to **Window → Preflight**.
2. This panel will tell you if you have:
   - **Overset Text:** (Text that doesn't fit in a frame).
   - **Low Resolution Images:** (Anything under 300 DPI).
   - **Missing Fonts.**
3. Fix all red markers before finalizing the page count.

---

## 5. What's Next?

Once you are happy with the layout:

1. Note the **Final Page Number** (e.g., page 242).
2. Let me know the count, and I will calculate your **Spine Width** for the cover.
3. We will then design the cover in the **Vector Studio** area of the app.
