### Template 1: Cold Outreach (Influencer)

**Subject:** A field manual for the part of us that wants to win

Hi [NAME],

I've been following your work on [SPECIFIC CONTENT/TOPIC] and really appreciated [SPECIFIC POST/VIDEO/EPISODE]. Your approach to [THEME] resonates with what I've been working on.

I just published **THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command** — a practical guide that treats the brain like a ship with two forces fighting for control: the rational Operator and the reactive Passenger.

It's built on neuroscience and cognitive behavioral principles, but structured like a military field manual. No fluff, just protocols: Morning Watch, Evening Debrief, H.A.L.T. checks, panic attack protocols, and more.

I'd love to send you a copy (physical or digital, your choice) — no strings attached. If it resonates, I'd be honored if you shared it with your audience. If not, I hope it's useful to you personally.

Here's a quick preview: [LINK TO FREE CHAPTER]

Either way, thank you for the work you do. It matters.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

### Template 2: Podcast Pitch

**Subject:** Podcast guest pitch: The neuroscience of self-sabotage

Hi [HOST NAME],

I'm a fan of [PODCAST NAME] — especially the episode with [GUEST] about [TOPIC]. Your approach to [THEME] is exactly the kind of conversation I want to be part of.

I recently published **THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command**, which explores why we sabotage ourselves and what actually works to stop it. The book uses a naval command metaphor to explain the brain:

- The **Operator** = prefrontal cortex (logic, planning, long-term thinking)
- The **Passenger** = limbic system (emotion, impulse, immediate gratification)

We could discuss:

- Why willpower fails and what to do instead
- The science of anxiety loops and how to break them
- Practical protocols for relapse, panic attacks, and 3 AM spirals
- How to build a "Bridge Crew" — the people who keep you accountable
- The difference between self-help that works and self-help that doesn't

I'm happy to tailor the conversation to your audience. Here's a bit more about me: [BIO LINK]

Would you be open to a 30-minute guest spot?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

### Template 3: Book Reviewer Pitch

**Subject:** Review copy offer: THE RED BOOK

Hi [NAME],

I came across your reviews of [SIMILAR BOOK TITLES] and thought THE RED BOOK might be up your alley.

**THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command** is a practical self-help book that uses a naval metaphor to teach neuroscience-backed protocols for:

- Breaking anxiety loops
- Managing relapse and shame spirals
- Building daily rituals that stick
- Designing your environment for success

It's not a typical self-help book — it's structured like a field manual with actionable protocols, templates, and case studies.

I'd love to send you a review copy. Let me know if you'd prefer physical or digital.

No obligation to review, but if you do, I'd be grateful.

Thanks for considering it!

### Template 4: Newsletter Feature Request

**Subject:** Possible feature: The Red Book

Hi [NAME],

I've been reading [NEWSLETTER NAME] for a while — your piece on [TOPIC] was excellent.

I'm reaching out because I recently published a book that I think would resonate with your readers: **THE RED BOOK: A Field Manual for Self-Command**.

It's a neuroscience-backed guide to managing the internal battle between our rational self (the Operator) and our reactive self (the Passenger). The book is structured like a military field manual with:

- Daily protocols (Morning Watch, Evening Debrief)
- Crisis protocols (panic attacks, relapse, 3 AM anxiety)
- Environment design principles
- Templates for personal Standing Orders

I'd be happy to write a guest piece, do a Q&A, or provide an excerpt if you think your readers would find it valuable.

Either way, thank you for the work you do.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
