# The Red Book: Final Publishing Checklist

## Phase 1: Interior Polish (Affinity V1)

- [ ] **Styles Applied:** Every chapter title uses `H1-Chapter`, every section uses `H2-Section`.
- [ ] **Widows/Orphans:** Check the last lines of paragraphs to ensure no single words are left alone at the top of a page.
- [ ] **Page Numbers:** Verify they start on the first page of Chapter 0 and continue to the end.
- [ ] **Cross-References:** Click through a few links in your PDF export to ensure the `[#chapter-x]` anchors work.
- [ ] **Operator's Orders:** Ensure the gray boxes are consistent throughout (Phase 6 of Layout Guide).
- [ ] **Blank Pages:** Ensure all new sections / chapters start on a Right-Hand (Recto) page. If a chapter ends on a Right-Hand page, the next page (the back of it) should be blank.
