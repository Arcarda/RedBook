# ART DIRECTION PLAN: THE RED BOOK & FIELD JOURNAL

This document outlines the visual assets required to elevate the text from a "manual" to an "artifact."

**Aesthetic Direction:**
*   **Style:** Technical-Nautical / "Tactical Stoicism".
*   **Vibe:** 19th-Century Naval Manual meets Modern Neuroscience.
*   **Palette:** Stark Black & White, Deep Red Accents.
*   **Texture:** Ink bleed, map grids, weathered paper, schematic lines.

## 1. TECHNICAL DIAGRAMS (The Science)
*These clarify complex concepts in the text.*

| Slot ID | Location | Concept Description | Visual Prompt Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FIG-1.1** | Chapter 1 | **Command Hierarchy**<br>Passenger (Limbic) vs. Operator (PFC). | Lateral view of human skull. "Operator" is glowing circuit in forehead. "Passenger" is primal flame in center. Schematic labels. |
| **FIG-1.2** | Chapter 1 | **Brain Metabolics**<br>Energy Chart showing PFC usage. | Bar graph styled as a fuel gauge. "Operator System: High Draw" vs "Passenger System: Low Draw". |
| **FIG-3.1** | Chapter 3 | **The Sabotage Cycle**<br>The loop of Trigger -> Dopamine -> Regret. | Circular flow chart similar to an engine cycle. Gear-like visuals. "The Feedback Loop". |
| **FIG-3.2** | Chapter 3 | **Brain Interface Map**<br>PFC vs Amygdala. | Top-down brain schematic. "Mission Control" (PFC) vs "The Alarm" (Amygdala) connected by wiring. |

## 2. ATMOSPHERIC PLATES (The Vibe)
*Full-page Section Dividers to create pause and gravitas.*

| Slot ID | Location | Concept Description | Visual Prompt Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 4. NEXT STEPS (Generation Strategy)

**Phase 1: Diagrams (Midjourney / banana.dev)**
*   Focus on clean lines and clear text labels (or add text in Affinity).

**Phase 2: Atmosphere (ComfyUI)**
*   Use a "Charcoal and Ink" LoRA to get the gritty manual feel.
*   Generate at high res (upscaled) for print quality (300dpi).

**Phase 3: Integration**
*   Place atmospheric plates on the *Left Page* (Verso) facing the Section Title.
*   Place diagrams inline with text references.
